# Setting up MongoDB

1. Sign in or create an account for [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

2. Create a database, choosing the "shared" option is recommended.

Be sure to replace `exampleUser` and `<password>` with the values from step 3.

For instance, in this example the final URL would be:

`mongodb+srv://exampleUser:examplePassword@cluster0.vqhbsse.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority`

Now you can paste the URL into `config.json`, done!
